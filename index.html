                  My name is Ikenna Nwajagu. I am originally from Nigeria and moved to the U.S when I was thirteen years old in 2005.
                  I went to high school in Bridgeport, CT and later attended Fairfield University where I majored in Mathematics.
                  After graduating from college, I worked as an operations intern for a small start-up in Darien, CT. I later on 
                  taught at Achievement First Schools in Bridgeport and New-Haven where I was a middle school math teacher and tutor.
                  After two years with the organization, I went on to graduate school at Ohio University where I obtained my Masters of Science 
                  degree in Applied Mathematics. After graduate school, I went on to teach at Norwalk Community College for a year and later on at 
                  Capital Prep Harbor School where I am currently the Head Math Teacher for 11th and 12th grades. 
                  <br></br>
                  In addition to teaching, I am currently in a Full Stack Software Developer Bootcamp Program at the University of Connecticut. Throughout my educational and professional odyssey, I've always wanted to get into tech especially with my background in mathematics. But for some reason
                  I never took that leap. After much reflection, I decided that it was time for me to take the leap of faith and make the transition into becoming a Full-Stack Software Developer. I believe that the world revolves around technology and I want 
                  to attain all the necessary skills to adapt to the current state of affairs so that I can affect some change in this ever changing world.
